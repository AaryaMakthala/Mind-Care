## Project Overview

**Student Mind Care** is a comprehensive mental health platform engineered specifically for the Indian academic context. It addresses the growing need for accessible psychological support by providing a hybrid appointment management system.

The application leverages location-based logic to connect students with counselors, offering flexibility between in-person school sessions and private online consultations. Beyond scheduling, the platform serves as a digital wellness hub, providing curated therapeutic resources to aid in stress management.
